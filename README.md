# Whatsapp Bot

This bot works like this:
First it looks for new messages searching for the green circle in the screen(circle is in the images folder right above).
If the green circle is present, it clicks on the corresponding chat, gets the last received message and answers accordingly to the configuration.
Otherwise, the bot keeps searching until finding it, when the cycle starts again.
